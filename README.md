# Luby-Transform-Code
Luby Transform Code (LT Code), an error correction algorithm belonging to the “fountain” code class, a type of corrector code that can generate an infinite number of packets to reconstitute data lost during transfers across different networks.  This type of algorithm is particularly useful in the case of transmission without any way to ask to recover the data again
